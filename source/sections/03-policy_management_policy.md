# 3. Policy Management Policy

NashBio implements policies and procedures to maintain compliance and integrity of data. The Security Officer and Privacy Officer are responsible for maintaining policies and procedures and assuring all NashBio workforce members, business associates, customers, and partners are adherent to all applicable policies. Previous versions of policies are retained to assure ease of finding policies at specific historic dates in time.

## 3.2 Maintenance of Policies

1. All policies are stored and updated to maintain NashBio compliance with HIPAA, SOC2 and other relevant standards. Updates and version control are done similarly to source code control.
2. Policy update requests can be made by any workforce member at any time. Furthermore, all policies are reviewed annually by both the Security and Privacy Officer to assure they are accurate and up-to-date.
3. NashBio employees may request changes to policies using the following process:
  1. The NashBio employee initiates a policy change request by creating an Issue in the NashBio Quality Management System. The change request may optionally include a GitHub pull request from a separate branch or repository containing the desired changes.
  2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the policy change request.
  3. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
  4. If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required, and editing this company policy document with updated policies.
  5. If the policy change requires technical modifications to production systems, those changes are carried out by authorized personnel using NashBio's [change management process (ยง9.4)](#9.4-changing-existing-systems).
4. All policies are made accessible to all NashBio workforce members. 
   * The Security Officer also communicates policy changes to all employees via email. These emails include a high-level description of the policy change using terminology appropriate for the target audience.

   1. Version history of all NashBio policies is done via GitHub.
   2. Backup storage of all policies is done with Google Drive.
6. The policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited annually, or after significant changes occur to NashBio's organizational environment. Issues that come up as part of this process are reviewed by NashBio management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The process for reviewing polices is outlined below:
  1. The Security Officer initiates the policy review by creating an Issue in the NashBio Quality Management System.
  2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the current NashBio policies.
  3. If changes are made, the above process is used. All changes are documented in the Issue.
  4. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
  5. If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required, and editing this company policy document with updated policies.
  6. Policy review is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Quality Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.

Additional documentation related to maintenance of policies is outlined in [ยง5.3.1](#5.3-security-officer).
