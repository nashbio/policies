## 7.2 Access Establishment and Modification

1. Requests for access to NashBio Platform systems and applications are made formally using the following process:
  1. A NashBio workforce member initiates the access request by creating an Issue in the NashBio Quality Management System.
     * User identities must be verified prior to granting access to new accounts.
     * Identity verification must be done in person where possible; for remote employees, identities must be verified over the phone.
     * For new accounts, the method used to verify the user's identity must be recorded on the Issue.
  2. The Security Officer or Privacy Officer will grant access to systems as dictated by the employee's job title. If additional access is required outside of the minimum necessary to perform job functions, the requester must include a description of why the additional access is required as part of the access request.
  3. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
  4. If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required. The Security Officer or Privacy Officer then grants requested access.
     * New accounts will be created with a temporary secure password that meets all requirements from [ยง7.12](#7.12-password-management), which must be changed on the initial login.
     * All password exchanges must occur over an authenticated channel(e.g., phone call, encrypted email...).
     * For production systems, access grants are accomplished by adding the appropriate user account to the corresponding LDAP group.
     * For non-production systems, access grants are accomplished by leveraging the access control mechanisms built into those systems. Account management for non-production systems may be delegated to a NashBio employee at the discretion of the Security Officer or Privacy Officer .
2. Access is not granted until receipt, review, and approval by the NashBio Security Officer or Privacy Officer.
3. The request for access is retained for future reference.
4. All access to NashBio systems and services is reviewed and updated on an annual basis to ensure proper authorizations are in place commensurate with job functions. The process for conducting reviews is outlined below:
   1. The Security Officer initiates the review of user access by creating an Issue in the NashBio Quality Management System.
   2. The Security Officer is assigned to review levels of access for each NashBio workforce member.
   3. If user access is found during review that is not in line with the least privilege principle, the process below is used to modify user access and notify the user of access changes. Once those steps are completed, the Issue is then reviewed again.
   4. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
   5. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
   6. Review of user access is monitored on an annual basis using the Quality Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
5. Any NashBio workforce member can request change of access using the process outlined in [ยง7.2 paragraph 1](#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification).
6. Access to production systems is controlled using centralized user management and authentication.
7. Temporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business purposes.
   * Accounts are reviewed every 90 days to ensure temporary accounts are not left unnecessarily.
   * Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed.
8. In the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content, identification and authentication may not be required. This is the responsibility of NashBio Customers to define, and not NashBio.
9. Privileged users must first access systems using standard, unique user accounts before switching to privileged users and performing privileged tasks.
   * For production systems, this is enforced by creating non-privileged user accounts that must invoke `sudo` to perform privileged tasks.
   * Rights for privileged accounts are granted by the Security Officer or Privacy Officer using the process outlined in [ยง7.2 paragraph 1](#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification).
10. All application to application communication using service accounts is restricted and not permitted unless absolutely needed. Automated tools are used to limit account access across applications and systems.
11. Generic accounts are not allowed on NashBio systems.
12. Access to production or development systems is granted through encrypted, SSL tunnels that utilize two-factor authentication.
    * Two-factor authentication is accomplished using a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) or a Nashbio-provided physical security key (Yubikey) as the second factor.
    * VPN connections use 256-bit AES 256 encryption, or equivalent.
    * Sessions are automatically disconnected after 30 minutes of inactivity.
13. In cases of increased risk or known attempted unauthorized access, immediate steps are taken by the Security and Privacy Officer to limit access and reduce risk of unauthorized access.
14. Direct system to system, system to application, and application to application authentication and authorization are limited and controlled to restrict access.

## 7.3 Workforce Clearance

1. The level of security assigned to a user to the organization's information systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user's job classification.
2. All access requests are treated on a "least-access principle."
3. NashBio maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to sensitive data. As such, NashBio, including all workforce members, does not readily have access to any ePHI.

## 7.4 Access Authorization

1. Role based access categories for each NashBio system and application are pre-approved by the Security Officer, or an authorized delegate of the Security Officer.
2. NashBio utilizes hardware and software firewalls to segment data, prevent unauthorized access, and monitor traffic for denial of service attacks.

## 7.5 Person or Entity Authentication

1. Each workforce member has and uses a unique user ID(Google Workspace Account) and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.
2. Each Customer and Partner has and uses a unique user ID(Google Workspace Account) and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system. Configured through Google Workspace.

## 7.6 Unique User Identification

1. Access to the NashBio Platform systems and applications is controlled by requiring unique User Login IDs and passwords for each individual user and developer.  NashBio accomplishes this using SSO infrastructure authenticated using SSO through Google Workspace and two-factor authentication.
2. Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls (see below).
3. Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in plain text. They are stored encrypted at rest and through Last Pass.
4. Default accounts on all production systems, including root, are disabled.
5. Shared accounts are not allowed within NashBio systems or networks.
6. Automated log-on configurations that store user passwords or bypass password entry are not permitted for use with NashBio workstations or production systems.

## 7.7 Automatic Logoff

1. Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other individual when unattended by the users (ex. by using a password protected screen saver or logging off the system).
2. Information systems that access ePHI automatically log users off the systems after 15 minutes of inactivity, such as in the VUMC Application.
3. The Security Officer pre-approves exceptions to automatic log off requirements.

## 7.8 Employee Workstation Use

## 7.10 Employee Termination Procedures

1. The Human Resources Department (or other designated department), users, and their supervisors are required to notify the Security Officer upon completion and/or termination of access needs and facilitating completion of the "Termination Checklist".
2. The Human Resources Department, users, and supervisors are required to notify the Security Officer to terminate a user's access rights if there is evidence or reason to believe the following (these incidents are also reported on an incident report and is filed with the Privacy Officer):
   * The user has been using their access rights inappropriately;
   * A user's password has been compromised (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as the individual compromising the original password);
   * An unauthorized individual is utilizing a user's User Login ID and password (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as providing the unauthorized individual with the User Login ID and password).
3. The Security Officer will terminate users' access rights immediately upon notification, and will coordinate with the appropriate NashBio employees to terminate access to any non-production systems managed by those employees.
4. The Security Officer audits and may terminate access of users that have not logged into organization's information systems/applications for an extended period of time.

## 7.11 Paper Records

NashBio does not use paper records for any sensitive information. Use of paper for recording and storing sensitive data is against NashBio policies.

## 7.12 Password Management

1. User IDs, passwords, and physical security keys are used to control access to NashBio systems and may not be disclosed to anyone for any reason.
2. Users may not allow anyone, for any reason, to have access to any information system using another user's unique user ID and password.

   * a minimum length of 8 characters;
   * a mix of upper case characters, lower case characters, and numbers or special characters;
   * a requirement for two factor authentication;
   * account lockout after 10 invalid attempts;
   * all accounts with programatic data access require the use of a physical security key (yubikey) issued by NashBio;
4. All system and application passwords must be stored and transmitted securely and through Last Pass. 
   * Where possible, passwords should be stored in a hashed format using a salted cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 or equivalent).
   * Passwords that must be stored in non-hashed format must be encrypted at rest pursuant to the requirements in [ยง17.8](#17.8-production-data-security).
   * Transmitted passwords must be encrypted in flight pursuant to the requirements in [ยง17.9](#17.9-transmission-security).
5. Each information system automatically requires users to change passwords at a pre-determined interval as determined by the organization, based on the criticality and sensitivity of the ePHI contained within the network, system, application, and/or database.
6. Passwords are inactivated immediately upon an employee's termination (refer to the [Employee Termination Procedures in ยง7.10](#7.10-employee-termination-procedures)).
7. All default system, application, and Partner passwords are changed before deployment to production.
8. Upon initial login, users must change any passwords that were automatically generated for them.
9. Password change methods must use a confirmation method to correct for user input errors.
10. All passwords used in configuration scripts are secured and encrypted(o-keys).
11. If a user believes their user ID has been compromised, they are required to immediately report the incident to the Security Office.
12. In cases where a user has forgotten their password, the following procedure is used to reset the password.
    * The user submits a password reset request to the CTO. The request should include the system to which the user has lost access and needs the password reset.
    * An administrator with password reset privileges is notified and connects directly with the user requesting the password reset.
    * The administrator verifies the identity of the user either in-person or through a separate communication channel such as a phone call.
    * Once verified, the administrator sends the password reset link to the user.

Gsuite admin logging is used to track and store password reset requests. The Security Officer is the owner of this group and modifies membership as needed.

## 7.13 Access to ePHI

1. Employees may not download ePHI to any workstations used to connect to production systems.
2. Disallowing transfer of ePHI to workstations is enforced through technical measures.
   * All production access to systems is performed using SSL and Oauth2 authentication and where appropriate through a bastion/jump host accessed through SSL.

## 7.14 DaaS Customer Access to Systems

NashBio grants DaaS customer secure system access via Nashbio provided service account connections. This access is only to Customer-specific systems and databases, no other systems in the environment. These connections are setup at customer deployment. These connections are secured and encrypted and are the only method for customers to connect to NashBio hosted systems.

Nashbio segments customers and customer data into customer-specific cloud projects.  Data insertion into the project is performed programatically and logged via Stackdriver, and in github.

In the case of data migration, NashBio does, on a case by case basis, support customers in importing data. In these cases NashBio requires that all data is secured and encrypted in transit, such as by using SFTP or SCP for transferring files.

In the case of an investigation, NashBio will assist customers, at NashBio's discretion, and law enforcement in forensics.
