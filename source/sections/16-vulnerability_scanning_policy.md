# 16. Vulnerability Scanning Policy

Nashbio is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis. Nashbio utilizes [Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center) from Google Cloud Platform (SCC) to consistently scan, identify, and address vulnerabilities on our systems. We also utilize [Stackdriver](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations) on all systems, including logs, for file integrity checking and intrusion detection.  Additionally, we use [Cavirin](https://www.cavirin.com) to monitor for misconfiguration vulnarabilties within our cloud environment.

## 16.2 Vulnerability Scanning Policy

1. SCC management is performed by the Nashbio Security Officer, or an authorized delegate of the Security Officer.
2. SCC is used to monitor all internal IP addresses (servers, VMs, etc) on Nashbio networks.
3. Frequency of scanning is as follows:
  1. on a continuous basis;
  2. after every production deployment.
4. Reviewing SCC reports and findings, as well as any further investigation into discovered vulnerabilities, is the responsibility of the Nashbio Security Officer. The process for reviewing SCC reports is outlined below:
  1. The Security Officer initiates the review of a SCC Report by creating an Issue in the Nashbio Quality Management System.
  2. The Security Officer, or a Nashbio Security Engineer assigned by the Security Officer, is assigned to review the SCC Report.
  3. If new vulnerabilities are found during review, the process outlined below is used to test those vulnerabilities. Once those steps are completed, the Issue is then reviewed again.
  4. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review.
  5. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
5. In the case of new vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:
  * All new vulnerabilities are verified manually to assure they are repeatable. Those not found to be repeatable are manually tested after the next vulnerability scan, regardless of if the specific vulnerability is discovered again.
  * Vulnerabilities that are repeatable manually are documented and reviewed by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer to see if they are part of the current risk assessment performed by Nashbio.
    * Those that are a part of the current risk assessment are checked for mitigations.
    * Those that are not part of the current risk assessment trigger a new risk assessment, and this process is outlined in detail in the Nashbio Risk Assessment Policy.
6. All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 3 years by Nashbio. Vulnerability report review is monitored on a quarterly basis using the  Quality Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
7. Penetration testing is performed on an as-needed-basis as part of the Nashbio vulnerability management policy.  NashBio relies on managed services for many of its core applications and routine penetration testing is performed by the hosting provider (Google, AWS).
  * External penetration testing, when needed, is performed by a third party.
  * Internal penetration testing is also performed as needed. Below is the process used to conduct internal penetration tests.
      1. The Security Officer initiates the penetration test by creating an Issue in the Nashbio Quality Management System.
      2. The Security Officer, or a Nashbio Security Engineer assigned by the Security Officer, is assigned to conduct the penetration test.
      3. Gaps and vulnerabilities identified during penetration testing are reviewed, with plans for correction and/or mitigation, by the Nashbio Security Officer before the Issue can move to be approved.
      4. Once the testing is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further testing and review.
      5. If the Issue is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
  * Penetration tests results are retained for 3 years by Nashbio.
  * Internal penetration testing is monitored using the Quality Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
