# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Nashbio understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Nashbio is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Nashbio has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Nashbio Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 Data Retention Policy

* Current Nashbio Customers may have data stored by Nashbio as a part of the Nashbio Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
  1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
  2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Nashbio and/or to have Nashbio continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, Nashbio will work with Customer to determine storage costs.
  3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Nashbio within 30 days, Nashbio removes data from Nashbio systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
